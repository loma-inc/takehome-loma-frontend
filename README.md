# Loma Take Home
Loma enables "click-to-deploy" commerce for online communities. Our platform lets any community organizer launch lightweight commerce rails for its members, including models like peer-to-peer marketplaces, sponsored classifieds, and directories.

## Project Goal
The goal of this assignment is to create a View Listing page which displays the contents of a listing related to both a sneaker marketplace and a hotel booking platform.

We are more interested in the design and layout of your code than the visual appearance, its ok if it is visually basic. To reduce the amount of time spent, its not required that the frontend component communicates with the backend. Instead, you can provide mock data in `src/App.js` that is passed to `src/ListingPage.js`.

It is expected that you will spend up to 4 hours on the backend and frontend pieces of this project combined. The intent is to replace several traditional "onsite" interviews and coding sessions with one project that is done on your own time in an environment that is more similar to your usual setup.

## Assessment
We'll be looking at the design and architecture of your solution, including how you structure your code and adherence to best practices. 

## Submission
Submit a link to a GitHub (or other) repository, or zip file via email to sean@loma.tech. Please provide a README that briefly explains your solution and any decisions that you would like to highlight.

Don't hesitate to reach out to sean@loma.tech if you have any questions.
